# Collaborative LaTeX document

This folder contains a master LaTeX file and a folder for each student. The students are expected to edit the file named after their roll number in their respective folder. Any figures can also be placed in the same folder. Use the "make once" and "make all" commands to compile the master LaTeX file. Do not forget to run "make clean" before pushing your files to git.
